        <h1>Christopher's Top 3 Restaurants in Saipan</h1>
        <p>Saipan is a pretty small island, with not too much to do... other than EAT!! This website contains
            my top 3 restaurants I know will satisfy my taste buds. If you aren't into Asian cuisine, you may leave since all
            3 restaurants revolve around the diverse ingredients and flavors that Asian cuisine has to offer. 
        </p>

            Himawari is a Japanese restaurant located in Garapan. They offer competitive prices for great food 
            compared to most restaurants.<br>The food could be described as savory as well as fulfilling. 
            From raw fish to deep-fried pork, to a hot bowl of udon or a nice cold salad,<br> Himawari has 
            it all for those with different diets, cravings, or how much of an appetite a person might have.
