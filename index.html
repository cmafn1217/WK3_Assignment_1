        <h1>Christopher's Top 3 Restaurants in Saipan</h1>
        <p>Saipan is a pretty small island, with not too much to do... other than EAT!! This website contains
            my top 3 restaurants I know will satisfy my taste buds. If you aren't into Asian cuisine, you may leave since all
            3 restaurants revolve around the diverse ingredients and flavors that Asian cuisine has to offer. <br> (To see more 
            about the restaurants, please refer to <em>Info about the Restaraunts</em> in the header and footer.)
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>My Top 3 Restaurants</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Himawari</li>
            <li>Chun Ji</li>
            <li>Savory Kitchen</li>

        <p>
            Himawari is a Japanese restaurant located in Garapan. They offer competitive prices for great food 
            compared to most restaurants.<br>The food could be described as savory as well as fulfilling. 
            From raw fish to deep-fried pork, to a hot bowl of udon or a nice cold salad,<br> Himawari has 
            it all for those with different diets, cravings, or how much of an appetite a person might have.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2><em>2. Chun Ji</em></h2>
        <img src="myimages/646e1c1757a79.image.jpg" alt="Image of the table inside Chun Ji Restaurant" class="bordered-image">
        <p>
            Chun Ji is a Korean Restaurant located in Garapan. I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone with a
            passion for cooking their own food. <br>Chun Ji offers premium quality meat, soups, and other korean dishes for a 
            premium quality price. It isn't the cheapest Korean BBQ places<br> in Saipan, but it is popular with tourists and some of the locals.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2><em>3. Savory Kitchen</em></h2>
        <img src="myimages/64ba92f0879f0.jpg" alt="Image of Savory Kitchen" class="bordered-image">
        <p>
            Savory is a Filipino-styled restaurant located in middle road. Recently, Savory has moved from Beach Road, Garapan, to middle road.<br>
            The new opening isn't so recent, but despite the location, their food is still superb. Savory has authentic Filipino dishes, as well as 
            their <br>on twist on foods from different culutres. For example, their Korean-Styled Short Ribs.
